# CleanMind — MVP v1.0

## 1. Product Overview

CleanMind is a mobile application designed to help users intentionally reduce access to pornographic content and distracting platforms through friction, accountability, and conscious decision-making.

---

## 2. Core Principles

- Friction over force
- Accountability over punishment
- Visibility over secrecy
- No shame-based UX

---

## 3. Platforms

- iOS (phones only)
- Android (phones only)

Tablets and web access are out of scope for the MVP.

---

## 4. Core Features

- VPN/DNS-based content blocking
- Temporary unlocks
- Controlled total protection deactivation
- Accountability notifications

---

## 5. Protection Model

- Protection is NOT enabled automatically
- The user must explicitly activate protection
- Protection remains ON unless intentionally disabled

---

## 6. Deactivation Philosophy

CleanMind allows full deactivation only through intentional effort.

Deactivation:
- Is explicit
- Requires friction
- Is visible
- Notifies a friend or parent
- Does not auto-reactivate

---

## 7. Free vs Pro

Free Plan:
- Limited temporary unlocks
- Fixed 8-hour waiting period for total deactivation

Pro Plan:
- Unlimited temporary unlocks
- User-defined waiting period for total deactivation

---

## 8. Privacy & Legal

- No browsing history inspection
- No access to messages or conversations
- No selling of user data

---

## 9. Out of Scope (Post-MVP)

- Tablets and iPads
- Web dashboard
- Multi-profile parental control
