# CleanMind — MVP v1.0

## 1. Product Overview

CleanMind is a mobile application designed to help users intentionally reduce access to pornographic content and distracting digital platforms through friction, accountability, and conscious decision-making.

The app focuses on creating intentional pauses, visibility, and support rather than punishment or shame.

---

## 2. Target Users

- Adults seeking digital detox
- Young adults
- Parents who install the app on their children’s devices
- Users who value accountability and support over restriction alone

The app maintains a neutral, non-religious tone.

---

## 3. Core Principles

- Friction over force  
- Accountability over punishment  
- Visibility over secrecy  
- Progress over perfection  
- No shame-based UX  

---

## 4. Platforms (MVP Scope)

- iOS (phones only)
- Android (phones only)

Tablets, iPads, and web dashboards are out of scope for the MVP.

---

## 5. Core Features (MVP)

- VPN/DNS-based content blocking
- Explicit protection activation
- Temporary unlocks with intentional friction
- Controlled total protection deactivation
- Accountability notifications
- Free and Premium subscription tiers

---

## 6. Protection Model

- Protection is NOT activated automatically after installation
- The user must explicitly activate protection
- Once activated, protection remains ON by default
- Protection can only be disabled through intentional actions defined by the product

---

## 7. Unlock & Deactivation Philosophy

CleanMind differentiates clearly between:

- **Temporary Unlock**: short, time-limited access with automatic restoration  
- **Total Protection Deactivation**: full disabling of protection until the user manually reactivates it

Total deactivation:
- Requires explicit user intent
- Applies intentional friction
- Does NOT restore automatically
- Is always visible
- Notifies accountability contacts

---
