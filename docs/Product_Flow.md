# CleanMind — Product Flow

## 1. Initial State (Post-Registration)

After installation and registration, CleanMind does NOT activate protection automatically.

- Protection status: INACTIVE
- The device is not protected
- The user is clearly informed of this state

The only available action is:

Activate Protection

---

## 2. Protection Activation

Protection becomes active only after an explicit user action.

When protection is activated:
- VPN/DNS-based blocking is enabled
- Protection becomes the default operating state
- Protection is considered intentionally active

The user is informed that:
- Protection is designed to stay ON
- Protection is not meant to be disabled casually
- Accountability and visibility are core principles

---

## 3. Protected State (Normal Operation)

When protection is active:
- Blocked content cannot be accessed
- The user may request temporary unlocks
- The user may request total protection deactivation
- There is no simple ON/OFF toggle

---

## 4. Temporary Unlock (Partial, Time-Limited)

Temporary unlock allows short, intentional access while protection remains conceptually active.

Characteristics:
- Always time-limited
- Countdown is visible
- Protection is restored automatically when time expires

Available methods:
1. Timed text copy (30 seconds)
2. Accountability confirmation (friend or parent)

Temporary unlock does NOT permanently disable protection.
