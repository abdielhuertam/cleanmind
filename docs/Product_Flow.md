# CleanMind — Product Flow

## 1. Post-Registration State

After completing registration, CleanMind does NOT activate protection automatically.

- Protection status: OFF
- The device is not protected yet
- The user is informed clearly of this state
- Primary action available:
  **Activate Protection**

---

## 2. Protection Activation

When the user activates protection:

- VPN/DNS blocking is enabled
- This becomes the default operating state
- Protection cannot be freely disabled

The user is informed that:
- Protection is meant to stay ON
- Temporary unlocks are intentional and limited
- Uninstalling the app interrupts protection and may notify accountability contacts

---

## 3. Normal Protected State

With protection active:

- Blocked content cannot be accessed
- The user may request a temporary unlock
- There is no permanent “off” switch

---

## 4. Temporary Unlock Flow

Users may temporarily disable protection using:

- Timed text copy (30 seconds)
- Accountability code (via external messaging)
- Automatic unlock

Unlocks are always time-limited.
When the timer ends, protection is restored automatically.
